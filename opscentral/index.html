            </div>
            <div class="col-body">
              <p>
                OpsCentral allows financial institutions leveraging the Interswitch network for payments to manage back-office operations like tracking settlements, logging disputes, generating reports and more all in one place.
              </p>
              <p>
                These operations were previously scattered across many products. For example, Arbiter handled disputes while Extraswitch handled transaction reports. Interswitch created OpsCentral to provide a single access point for all transaction-related activities. This case study discusses the migration of “Reports” to OpsCentral and the redesign of the experience to better serve customers.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Reports feature is a critical tool for financial institutions. It provides officers with comprehensive insights into transactions and enables them to access and analyse data that supports reconciliation, compliance, performance tracking, and strategic decision-making.

            </div>
            <div class="col-body">
              <p>After laying out user problems, it was clear that our primary issue was rigidity. We had our challenge: "How do we make Reports flexible enough to allow users the ability to choose what exactly they want from it?" We wanted to make it possible for customers to query the platform however they pleased.
              </p>
              <p>However, we knew that there were engineering constraints that could limit the level of flexibility we aimed to achieve. Because of this, I laid out 2 approaches that afforded users with different levels of flexibility. We shared these ideas with the wider product team so that together we could decide what may be achieved in the short term and what to push till after the backend was made more amenable.

                    </div>
                    <p>This idea kept the existing pre-generated reports format from Extraswitch but made it easier for customers to find, sort and download them. It also included usability enhancements that addressed many of the identified problems such as complexity with navigation, individual downloads etc.</p>

              With approach 1, we were able to provide users with visualisation, much improved usability, streamlined reporting workflows and better operational efficiency. We tested our solutions with select customers before wider deployment and monitored usage with Microsoft Clarity. A few solutions and their impacts are highlighted below:

                    Favourite Reports allows users to bookmark key reports. We also used it to float relevant reports to the top for related user roles. These reports are stored in top-level locations with notifications sent when they are ready for download.
